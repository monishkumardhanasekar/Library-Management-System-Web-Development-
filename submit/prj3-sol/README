For this project, I implemented API routes to facilitate various functionalities of the library management system. These routes allow users to interact with the system programmatically, enabling actions such as adding new books, searching for books based on specific criteria, checking out books to patrons, and clearing out library data. By accessing these routes, users can seamlessly perform tasks to manage the library's inventory and facilitate smooth operations.
